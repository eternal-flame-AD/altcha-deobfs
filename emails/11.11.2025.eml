Subject: [SECURITY] Data Obfuscation function has Instant Constant Time
 Solution

Hi Altcha Team,


I am writing to inform you of a design issue concerning your "Data 
Obfuscation" feature. Per your documentation at 
https://altcha.org/docs/obfuscation/ , you mentioned "obfuscation 
employs a proof-of-work (PoW) approach based on symmetric AES 
encryption." You further quantified "Decryption complexity depends on 
the number range used."Â  which I interpret as it should not have a 
constant time solution.

However, in your setup where the adversary gets control of both the key 
and the entire ciphertext, a constant time-space solution exists by 
inverting AES-GCM auth tags.The initialization block can be computed as 
generating the authentication input, XOR with the observed tag, then 
decrypt using AES-ECB, then we can work forward to decrypt the rest of 
the data as normal.

A graphical representation is available here: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode#Basic_operation , we 
will start working out the values below node "Ciphertext X", then at the 
final XOR we know the auth tag so we can compute E_k(iv), which we can 
then invert with E^(-1) (i.e. AES decryption) to recover initial state 
"Counter 0".



Here is a proof of concept using the "security@altcha.org" string on 
your contact page: 
https://gist.github.com/eternal-flame-AD/64e82c7733ddb21d466a9b4d83f7d00e


Per your SECURITY.md policy, I will hold this for embargo until next 
Friday (more than 5 business days), if I have not heard anything back by 
then I may consider it out of scope and publish it since there is no 
real CIA impact here just an obfuscation taking much less effort than 
intended.

Thanks,

Yumechi
